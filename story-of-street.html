  <p>STORY OF STREET 2019</p>
  <p>My series of works is observation of our interconnectedness with things (that surround us every day), with streets, with buildings, trees, people, windows, skies, birds, tables, doors… Gregory Bateson’s example of a blind man with a stick, in which he is questioning where blind’s man mind starts, at the end of a stick, at the middle and so on, leads me to the following questions: how do we know where one form ends and other begins? How do we know where our body ends and nature begins? We see a building, for example. Building can be seen as a form, not as functional construction. And when we look at it, we create some sort of connection with it.</p>
  <p>It is said, that in quantum physics, that the mere observation of a phenomenon inevitably changes that phenomenon.</p>
  <p>In the book “The Universe in a Single Atom: The Convergence of Science and Spirituality“ by Dalai Lama, he explains: “The notion of a pre-given, observer-independent reality is untenable. As in the new physics, matter cannot be objectively perceived or described apart from the observer—matter and mind are co-dependent.”</p>
  <p>And why I explore those theories, is maybe because I myself don’t believe in objective reality.</p>
  <p>If this is true and there is no objective reality, then our connection to it – is the most important thing in creating this reality.</p>
  <p>In my works I explore those connections between me and city. I make my own portrait of the city, of its streets, buildings, windows, transports… I take a picture of a space in the city, turn it upside down to free it from gravity, top and bottom, then I add graphic forms and lines. I am transforming the reality of city by deconstructing forms of it, adding elements and shapes.</p>
