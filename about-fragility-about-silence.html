    We’ve learned inevitability of death, Remark said it in one of his books.
  </p>

  <p>
    But how can we learn life? How can one not to be afraid to live? How can we ﬁnd purpose in life and is it really
    necessary? What if all, that we see around, is just a picture, an illusion, behind which something real is hidden?
    And what if not? Maybe we will die and our soul will die together with body, if such exists at all. To what extend
    our life is important? And to whom?
  </p>

  <p>
    There are lot of practices to know oneself better, different kinds of meditation, lot of books about life after
    death, lot of religions, which try to explain purpose of life. But what is the sense of our existence right here
    right now? And do we need to think about it, or maybe it is better to just live. There are lot of options, each
    person chooses most suitable path and sense of life for oneself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mine turned out to be art. For me this is a path into quietness. Silence with myself. This is a path into colour,
    into deepness. Connection with paint and its structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would like you to feel the space, where you can be distant from worries and troubles, where quietness is. In it
    you can get rid off uncertainties and doubts, as if you are ﬂoating in the air or in the water, in the devouring
    feeling of lightness. Lightness of body, mind, life. Space with artworks is the space in which you can enter and
    dissolve there. It is the space out of time.
