    Nothing ever disappears. Ever civilization leaves traces behind. They are invisible, hidden under the ancient rocks of the earth, hidden by the new generations. Former nomads became modern consumers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Proclaiming knowledge as the main value of a new human formation, postindustrial civilization can’t get rid of a habit of industrial consumption. There are more technologies, more ideas for buying and selling goods, and as a result, consumption becomes much easier. Artiﬁciality, speed and pleasure are the things, that important to modern human. Knowledge, that is fast accumulated by humankind, creates a so called gap between modern civilization and the experience of ancestors. We are moving away from our roots and lose connections with nature. The most important for modern person is speed, ancient observation has remained in history.

  <p>
    The circle of artiﬁcial ﬂowers, made by art group Light, symbolically stops time. Bright colors in winter landscapes of Scythian settlement is like a warning sign to stop and think what we (modern consumers) will leave behind. What kind of history layer will be found by the future archaeologists? Will our successors criticize our plastic period? Or won't they? The choice is ours.
