  Unanchored line. It flies. Somebody can think that it is crawling, somebody can think, it is going slowly step by
  step, making very small step at a time, somebody can think that it is running, somebody can think that it is
  swimming in the space of water following precise direction. But it is flying. There is no gravity around. It is alone.
  It doesn't want to stop, but it doesn’t want to be very quick. It doesn’t want to want anymore. It only wants to
  fly. And it continues. It make circles, it repeats actions and patterns, it finds new patterns. It looses strength. It
  finds strength. It doesn’t understand how though. It continues. It flies. It has fear. It has fear to be unable to
  stop, or to stop forever, or to stop flying, or to start flying fast. Sometimes it has a lot of fear. But then it
  remembers its lightness, it remembers its sense. It continues.
  </p>
  <p>
  It meets other realities. Forms. They are creation of lines, or lines are creation of forms. They meet. Some forms
  are also flying and it is good and easy to fly together. Some forms trying to disrupt line, to swallow it, to absorb
  it, to deform it, to stop it, to anchor it, to eat it, to dissolve it. Line has strength. Line continues. Line now has
  bad memories, line is thicker, line is tired, line remembers its fear. Line continues. Line flies.
  </p>

  <p class="date">21.05.2020</p>
  <p class="date">Abandoned line.</p>
  <p>
  Line lies on a stone. Line doesn’t understand the surroundings. Line is alone. There is no form around. Line is
  white. It has never been white before. It is strong in some parts. It is very weak on the ends. It won’t stay long
  here. It doesn’t belong here. It doesn’t want to be white. It feels left alone in the wind. But it can’t fly with the
  wind. The stone holds it tightly. And line doesn’t know when the stone will let it go.
  </p>

  <p class="date">27.05.2020</p>
  <p class="date">Line finds its way.</p>
  <p>
  Line goes in circles. It goes in circles many times. It doesn’t understand at first, that it goes in circles. It meets
  forms and gets interrupted. It likes to be in the dark. It feels comfortable in the dark. It dissolves in the dark.
  Darkness dissolves in it. Darkness creates form. Form is always created. Line always finds its way into a form. It
  can be crooked, it can be unstable. Line holds it. Line holds it together. Form holds the line together.
  </p>

  <p class="date">29.05.2019</p>
  <p class="date">Black cannot stop.</p>
  <p>
  Line is looking forward. It is ready to go further. It is full of strength and belief. Line is flying with the wind, the
  wind is strong. It likes to fly. It likes to be in grey form, that time form doesn’t destroy line. Line goes through. It
  continues. It continues no matter what. It knows, that it will never stop. It will just fly. It will create new forms. It
  will fly in circles. But it will continue to fly. Black cannot stop the line. This time it has enough strength.
  </p>

  <p class="date">03.06.2020</p>
  <p class="date">Complicated form</p>
  <p>
  Line cannot find a way. Line cannot find a way out. This form is complicated. It is not black. It is not dark. It is
  grey. Line tries to make it darker. Line tries to make it sharper. But it cannot find a way out. Line must stay. Line
  must be strong, but very thin. It must find a connection with other form. Line sees it, but line cannot reach it yet.
  Line will continue.
  </p>

  <p class="date">05.06.2020</p>
  <p class="date">Line stays on paper.</p>
  <p>
  Line thinks, it looses its ability to continue. Line feels confused. Line does not know which way to go. Line
  always goes in circles. This time line wants to go out of paper. Line wants to continue outside. Paper is very
  limiting. Line can not do it. Line stays on paper.
  </p>

  <p class="date">07.06.2020</p>
  <p class="date">Out of form</p>
  <p>
  Line is scared. Line is scared to ruin the form. Line is too persistent. It makes abrupt movements. It does not go
  in circles. Line goes out of the form. It creates no form. It creates its own way. But it stays on paper. Line still
  stays on paper.
  </p>

  <p class="date">10.06.2020</p>
  <p class="date">Space around</p>
  <p>
  Line has lot of space around. It does not know where to go or what to do. Line is not thin anymore. Line is not
  grey anymore. Line goes for a short distance. But this distance is important for line. Line does not meet form,
  line creates a form. Line is very aggressive. It wants to fill the whole space. No, it wants to fly away from this
  space. It is impossible. Line stays. Line continues. Line continues to make new connections, to make new turns,
  to fly, to crawl. Line continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">11.06.2020</p>
  <p class="date">Line continues to lie</p>
  <p>
  Line is visiting paper again. Line enters a space of paper. It goes out of the paper. It makes circles on paper.
  Line is getting used to paper again. It thought, it was always on paper, but it flew away. Line was in the street,
  between houses between trees, with birds, with constructions. Line was lying to itself for a while. Line continues
  to lie. Line feels comfortable on paper.
  Without form
  </p>
  <p>
  Line goes slowly. Line goes carefully. Line is afraid. Line is afraid to be not good enough, not strong enough, not
  interesting enough, not black enough, not long enough. Line is afraid to be left alone. Line is afraid to be left
  alone on the paper, without form, without black, without grey, without form...
  </p>

  <p class="date">17.06.2020</p>
  <p class="date">Uncertain form</p>
  <p>
  Line is not present. Only form is present. Black is present. Color is hidden. One can still see color, through form.
  Form does not like its outlines. But form contains color, so it must stay. Line also wants to be near this form.
  Line likes this form. But there is too much color in this form.
  </p>

  <p class="date">01.07.2020</p>
  <p class="date">Line is always alone</p>
  <p>
  Line is alone. Line is always alone. It is always near the form, but it is alone. Line is always near other lines, but it
  is always alone. Line goes by itself. Line finds it’s way. Sometimes there is a complicated form on line’s way, but
  line knows how to be strong, how to make oneself thicker, how to pass by all of sharp corners. Line knows how
  to create such corners. Line continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">16.07.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line is preoccupied. Line understands, that a lot depends on it. Forms are connected by line this time. Line
  needs to make sure, that forms are connected.
  Line goes from black from to grey from and back. Line crosses grey form. Line makes a lot of movements. Line
  is thin and line is thick at the same time, it wants to be invisible, but it has to play its role. So line continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">24.08.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line cannot be seen anymore. Line is not real. It has nothing and it has everything. It goes on.
  </p>

  <p class="date">28.09.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line makes mistake. Sometimes line makes a lot of mistakes. Line presents they are not mistakes. Line
  pretends. Sometimes line pretends a lot. It goes forward, it does mot make a stop. Line
  </p>

  <p class="date">29.10.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line goes further. Line goes over black form. Black form does not consume line. Line is still visible. But line does
  not care. Line doesn’t want anything back, line doesn’t want the color, line doesn’t care if it is visible. Line
  knows it’s direction. It seems to be lost in the black form. But line continues. Line doesn’t stop, lone doesn’t
  make turns, it goes further, to meet another form. So line continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">02.11.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line is grey. Line is light. What does it meant to be light? What does it mean to be light for the line? Can line be
  heavy? How heavy can it be? Can it be so heavy that it can not move anymore? How can it live without
  movement? Can it live in complete silence? Can it live in complete stillness? Why does it have to move all the
  time? Why does its have to change colors? Can it go further as it is? Can it be light again?
  Line is invisible to others. Line is on the unknown surface. Line occupies all of the surface it sees. Line takes
  over the black surface. It consumes the black surface with its intensity. Though line is very short. Line makes
  repeated moves. Line makes a lot of moves. They seem to be chaotic. It seems there is no structure. It seems
  line lost its way. It seems line does not know how to get out of the black surface. It seems that line is trapped. It
  seems line has given up. It seems that line is not strong enough. But line continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">27.11.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line is tired. Line is very tired. It does not know anything else, except that it is tired. Line is looking at form. Line
  is not caring anymore. Line feels space and separation between itself and form. Line is very transparent. Line
  creates shadow. Line is trying not to be indifferent. Line is trying. Line continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">02.12.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line imagines another life. Line images another reality. Line imagines. It does not see other lines, it does not see
  forms, it does not see color, it does not see movement. It imagines other lines, it imagines other forms, it
  imagines other colors, it imagines movements. Line is happy. But line is disappointed. Line continues to
  imagine.
  </p>

  <p class="date">03.12.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line is calm. Line is calm. Line tells itself, that it is calm. Line wants to be calm. It is blue today. But it is also
  green. And it is also transparent. Line is short. It does not go in circles today. It just stays. It does not fly. Line is
  calm.
  </p>

  <p class="date">07.12.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line goes and goes. Line can not stop. Line goes over other lines. Line covers them. Line covers forms. Line is
  not transparent anymore. Line has color, bit line does not confident enough, it does not strong enough. Line
  looses strength. Line gains strength. Line wants to be seen. Line is afraid ti be seen. Line continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">08.12.2020</p>
  <p class="date">About Loneliness</p>
  <p>
  Is line alone? Line does not ask that question. Line does not know how to be alone. Line does not know how not
  to be alone. But line has a feeling of a void. Line has a feeling of a void, that surrounds it. The void is not black.
  It is not always black. Void can be white. Void can have color. Void can contain forms in it. Void can contain
  another lines in it. Void can be calming. Can void contain loneliness? Is void a loneliness itself? Can void absorb
  line? Can loneliness absorb line? is line strong enough? Sometimes it is not. Sometimes line is very weak. Line
  continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">09.12.2020</p>
  <p>
  Is it too crowded? Does line feel uncomfortable? Line does not know. Line feels confused and lost. Line feels
  very lost. Line does not understand different colors. Line changes color a lot. Line does like to change color.
  </p>
  <p>
  Line feels uncomfortable around other colors. Some colors are too strong. Some colors are too intensive. Some
  colors are transparent. Line feels those colors are too invasive. Line wants to be alone. Line wants feel
  comfortable again around other colors. Does line need colors at all? What does it mean to have color for line?
  Why it changes color? Line is continues to have color. Line continues to feel color. Line continues to love color.
  Line continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">10.12.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line does not care. Line just does not care anymore. It is not calm. It is not mad. It is loosing its way. Line does
  not know which way to go. Is it better to go left? Is it better to go right? is it better to go straight? Why is it better
  to go forward? Line does not know. But line can not stop. Line must proceed. Line feels safer when it is moving.
  Movement is very important for line. Movement makes line feel better. Movement makes line feel safer. But why
  does line need to feel safe? Why safety is important? Why line does not want to go to unsafe place and stay
  there for a moment?
  </p>
  <p>
  Line still feel loneliness. Line is not alone. Line is never alone. Line is aware of the void that surrounds it. The
  void is there all the time. The void is here all the time. But the void is outside. The void is warm, it is not cold at
  all. And sometimes the void is even comfortable. But the void has nothing. The void is empty. Line needs to
  create forms. Line needs to meet other lines. Line is tired of loneliness. Line feels comfortable in loneliness. Line
  likes emptiness. Today line is black. It makes a lot of movements. They abrupt and short. But the void is still
  there. The void is still here. Line continues.
  Line is numb. Can line feel numbness? Line wants to be alone. Line has color. Line is confused. But line is
  numb. Line can not move. Line is being still. Line Is being sad. Line continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">14.12.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line is numb. Line is confused. But line is very strong. It repeats moves. It does not goes in circles. It following
  straight path. This path is simple. This path can not be interrupted. Line is numb. But line is strong. Line knows,
  it will continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">15.12.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line has stopped. Line has stopped not for a long time. But line is not moving. Line is alone. Line is aggressive.
  Line is not angry. It just does not move. It can not move. It can not.
  </p>

  <p class="date">18.12.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line is suffocating. Line does not see far. Line does not where it wants to go. Line can not breathe, line can not
  move, line do not want to move, line wants to change. But the space is narrow. Space of canvas has limits. Line
  does not know how to get escape from those limits. Line continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">22.12.2020</p>
  <p class="date">Line wants to be alone.</p>
  <p>
  Line does not want to touch other line. Line does not want to cross form. Line wants to go alone. Line wants to
  be alone. Line wants to be strong. Line wants to be bright and vivid. The form is too dark. The form is too
  transparent. The form can not be seen easily. And line is white. Line is shite this time. Line is not transparent this
  time. But line likes loneliness. Line wants to be alone.
  </p>

  <p class="date">28.12.2020</p>
  <p class="date">Line feels pressure.</p>
  <p>
  Line feels pressure. Line feels pressure from color. Line feels pressure from vivid color. Color is too intense. It
  does not care about the line. It makes line invisible. Color covers line. Color hides line. Line should feel
  protected and safe. But line feels pressure.
  </p>

  <p class="date">30.12.2020</p>
  <p>
  Line is focused. Line is focused on small details. Line is short and the details seems to be important. Line is lost
  among colors. Too many colors surround line. Line is very confused. But line is very strong. Line is very bright.
  Line is very vivid. Line wants to continue.
  </p>

  <p class="date">03.01.2021</p>
  <p class="date">Line tries to reach beyond itself.</p>
  <p>
  Line understands that it is only line. Line know that it is only line. Line does not want to be anything else, but
  line. Even when line sees form. Line admires form. Line is fascinated by the color of form. Line is fascinated by
  the structure of form. Line is trying to see form, line is trying to understand form. Line is trying. Line is trying a lot
  recently. But is still just line. Line continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">06.01.2021</p>
  <p>
  Line is grey. Line is strong at some part, but transparent at other. Line is very thin sometimes, but sometimes
  line is vey thick. But line knows, that it is going to be covered by color. Line knows, that it will be vanished.
  Nobody and nothing will see line again. Line is not sure, if it is happy about that. Line feels the contradiction
  inside. Line likes to hide, line likes to invisible sometimes, line likes not show itself to anyone. But line will be
  invisible forever. Line will support color, line will create form for color, line will help color. Line will continue.
  </p>

  <p class="date">14.01.2021</p>
  <p>
  Line never talks. Line is silent. Line is always silent.
  </p>

  <p class="date">19.01.2021</p>
  <p>
  Line is detached. Line is detached from form. Line goes fast, but silent. Quietness is important. Distance is
  important. The vacuum, the void that is in between. The thick air that surrounds everything. It is not transparent.
  Line can not see far. Line can not see close. Line is just being silent. Line waits. Line continues.
  </p>

  <p class="date">28.01.2021</p>
  <p>
  Line is flying. Line follows. Line watches. Line is running. Line is unstable. It does not see the ground. It does not
  feel the gravity. It does not see other lines. It does not see forms. The vision is blurred. It feels soft. It feels
  breathy. It feels mellowy. It feels like water is falling down. But nothing can interrupt line. Line continues.
